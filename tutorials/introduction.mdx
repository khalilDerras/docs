Welcome to our comprehensive guide on setting up and managing your billing infrastructure. Our billing service provides a robust solution for handling subscription plans, entitlements, and payments seamlessly.


## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Subscription Plans">
    We will set up your pricing tiers and features to create attractive subscription plans for your customers.
    <Note>
      Currently, we support fixed price plans.
    </Note>
    
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Entitlements">
    Map your subscription plans to specific entitlements, allowing fine-grained control over feature access.

    <Note>
      Entitlement creation is a manual process. We will collect your requirements and configure the entitlements on our side.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate Payment Providers">
    Connect with Stripe to process transactions securely and efficiently.

    <Note>
      We currently support only Stripe as our payment gateway. You'll need to link your Stripe account to our service, which requires a one-time configuration.
    </Note>
    <Tip>
      
      Once you've linked your Stripe account, you'll be able to process payments through our <Link href="/sdk/components/EmbeddedCheckoutForm">Embedded Checkout.</Link>
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement Billing Logic">
    Utilize our <Link href="/sdk/intro">SDK</Link> to handle subscription management, payment processing, and entitlement checks.

    
  </Step>
